                        <p>Divestment is not a new idea — it is a proven tactic with a well-defined theory of change. In the 1980s, many universities divested from companies profiting from the Apartheid regime in South Africa, putting international pressure on the South African government. In the 1990s, after reports of disinformation by tobacco companies and widespread divestment, most politicians stopped accepting campaign contributions from tobacco companies. In the 2000s, MIT itself divested from the Sudanese government during the Darfur crisis. Now, in 2013, as the magnitude and injustice of climate change become impossible to ignore, our mandate is clear: MIT must divest from the fossil fuel industry. <a href="https://thetech.com/2013/11/22/brown-v133-n56">[3]</a></p>

                        <p>For example, Fossil Free MIT is working hard to convince MIT to divest from fossil fuel companies. Once students, professors, and staff start questioning the ethics of investing in fossil fuel companies, one cannot help but scrutinize the more direct relationship that we have with these companies. If we are unwilling to invest funds in fossil fuel companies, how can we continue to let fossil fuel companies invest in us, while also training students for careers in the fossil fuel industry? <a href="https://thetech.com/2013/12/03/richardson-v133-n58">[4]</a></p>

                        <p>Indeed, divesting the endowment from fossil fuel-related corporations is fairly hypocritical if MIT continues to receive huge sums from these very corporations to fund energy research. And we doubt many would argue that a symbolic gesture of MIT’s supposed detachment from the industry is worth giving up the research these companies fund. <a href="https://thetech.com/2014/02/28/fossilfree-v134-n8">[5]</a></p>

                        <p>It is also true that divestment will risk losing funding for climate change and clean energy research. But strengthening climate change policy should take priority over improving clean energy technology because the former is significantly behind the latter. Improving the technology without creating a space for it to make an impact is not very helpful. Furthermore, if Stanford can do it, MIT can too. Admittedly, this is a simplistic argument, but I firmly believe that if MIT forges ahead, it can establish a new equilibrium around values that are compelled by the needs of a new era and align better with MIT’s core belief in serving society. <a href="https://thetech.com/2014/05/13/divest-v134-n26">[6]</a></p>

As the cost of climate change becomes more and more apparent, the Koch brothers will go down in history as villains, no matter how many cancer research centers and opera houses they fund...No other school can divest with the impact of MIT. No other school is so entwined with the Kochs, and no other school needs so badly to dissociate itself from their disastrous legacy. <a href="https://thetech.com/2014/11/07/letters53-v134-n53">[8]</a></p>

                        <p>So why did I sign the petition? I signed because the analysis above misses a key aspect of MIT’s mission, an important way that MIT faculty could benefit the world. MIT derives tremendous value from its reputation for integrity and scientific excellence and, as a result of that reputation, MIT has the credibility to educate a broad spectrum of the populace on issues that involve science and engineering. According to MIT’s Mission Statement: “The Institute is committed to generating, disseminating, and preserving knowledge, and to working with others to bring this knowledge to bear on the world’s great challenges.” We know the science of climate change, but many Americans are confused, if not badly misled. <a href="https://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/273/harvey.html">[9]</a></p>

                        <p>Until MIT itself divests from using fossil fuels, it would be hypocritical for us to sign a petition to divest from fossil fuel companies. Indeed, given that many fossil fuel companies have invested in MITei to help us find ways to address our world’s energy problems (supply and environmental issues), divestiture would be an act of ballistic podiatry followed by a round of Abbe Roulette. If we really want to “punish” fossil fuel companies, replace the “FFincome” from investment in fossil fuel companies with endowment funds and spend the “FFincome” on solar panels for all MIT roofs, energy saving windows…. First put our own money where our mouth is, then we will be free to preach to others. <a href="https://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/274/slocum.html">[10]</a></p>

                        <p>"I believe there’s an equal chance that the fossil fuel industry will need to increase its renewables research investments rather than decrease them if MIT shows how seriously it’s committed to climate action. There’s demonstrable proof for this — when ExxonMobil has refused to take action against climate change, it specifically cited its affiliation with MIT. If in the future, MIT says we’re more serious about taking climate action, [ExxonMobil] is going to have to point to work that it does in places like MIT...Personally I think it’s a gamble we have to take...I think it’s also worth mentioning that the call for divestment is not radical at all in that it’s consistent with the science for climate change mitigation. The divestment movement derives from peer-reviewed science."" <a href="https://thetech.com/2015/10/15/supran-v135-n27">[17]</a></p>

Our administration is playing catch-up in reducing campus emissions, is failing to align MIT’s investments with its mission and morals, and is seemingly afraid to speak out against companies undermining our own efforts. The Plan reflects an unwarranted belief that through an undefined course of engagement, MIT can convince the fossil fuel industry to leave its future profits underground. For all these reasons, we are sitting-in to urge MIT’s administration to raise their ambitions, starting by: 1) committing to divest from coal and tar sands companies, 2) addressing climate science disinformation by establishing an Ethics Advisory Committee, whose assessments can lead to disinformation-based divestment 3) committing to achieve campus carbon neutrality by 2040 at the latest, and striving to achieve this target as far ahead of schedule as possible.

Without greater leverage against these powerful corporations, we have no adequate means of persuading them to curtail their exploration and extraction of trillions of dollars worth of fossil fuels, whose use would cause irreparable climate catastrophe; to cease lobbying against clean energy in an effort to create political gridlock; and to stop spending untold millions undermining the science of global climate change. Targeted divestment from coal and tar sands is justified on scientific, economic, moral, and political grounds. It is an approach that has won the support of Stanford, Oxford, the University of California, and the Australian Academy of Science, among others.

While the CAP is dismissive of stigmatization strategies, a study by the University of Oxford concludes that “[t]he outcome of the stigmatization process, which the fossil fuel divestment campaign has now triggered, poses the most far-reaching threat to fossil fuel companies… and could impact fossil fuel companies… through legislation.” Aside from the ethical implications of benefitting from carbon pollution, as a university committed to creating a “Better World,” MIT has a duty to use its global prominence to make a strong political statement and reject the fossil fuel industry’s destructive practices through divestment.”<a href="https://thetech.com/2016/11/03/cap-anniversary">[25]</a></p>

                        <p>"Approximately 4 out of every 5 respondents stated they care about MIT's relationship with fossil fuel companies and support divestment; about 10% said they were unsure about divestment and only 6% disagreed. Finally, while many respondents stated they had researched and formed strong opinions on fossil fuel divestment, less than half were invested in providing input on the Climate Action Plan.”<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sRMQL-w5Kybn4bcHKQBqU1xJ5rcdVIby/view">[32]</a> </p>

                        <p>"Zuber told The Tech that MIT chose not to include divesting from fossil fuel companies in the new plan because fossil fuel stocks and companies “provide a critical product on which the operation depends,” and it seemed that divestment would not “accelerate progress towards decarbonization."”<a href="https://climate.mit.edu/climateaction/fastforward">[34]</a> <a href="https://thetech.com/2021/05/13/climate-action-plan-2021">[35]</a></p>
